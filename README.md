Using the Gemini Nano API, GitMe allows you to quickly generate a customized README based on your project details, saving you valuable time and effort. Currently offering unlimited free README generations, GitMe aims to make README creation accessible and efficient for all developers. Future updates will include a credit system and enhanced features.

## Installation

This code represents the frontend of the application. A backend using the Gemini Nano API is required for full functionality. To run this frontend:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

Note: You'll need to configure the application to connect to your Gemini Nano API backend.
