# GitMe: Your README. Simplified.

## Description

GitMe is a tool designed to streamline the creation of professional, polished README files for your GitHub projects. Using the Gemini Nano API, GitMe allows you to quickly generate a customized README based on your project details, saving you valuable time and effort. Currently offering unlimited free README generations, GitMe aims to make README creation accessible and efficient for all developers. Future updates will include a credit system and enhanced features.

## Features

* **Fast and Easy Setup:** Get started quickly with a simple, intuitive interface.
* **Customizable Markdown:** Tailor your README to match your project's style and branding.
* **API-Powered Performance:** Leverages the Gemini Nano API for fast and reliable README generation.
* **Collaborator-Ready Outputs:** Create READMEs that impress your collaborators and attract contributors.
* **Multiple Templates (Future Update):** Choose from a variety of templates to fit your project's needs.

## Technologies Used

* React
* Framer Motion
* React Toastify
* Gemini Nano API

## Installation

This code represents the frontend of the application. A backend using the Gemini Nano API is required for full functionality. To run this frontend:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

Note: You'll need to configure the application to connect to your Gemini Nano API backend.

## Contribution

This project was created solo for the **Google Made with AI Hackathon**. It is my first-ever fully working and responsive self-made project. The login and credit system are still to be added. Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the project, submit issues, or create pull requests for enhancements or fixes.

## Future Enhancements

* Implementation of a credit system.
* User login/authentication.
* Expanded template selection.
* Advanced customization options.
* Support for multiple output formats.
